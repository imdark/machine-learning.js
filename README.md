machine learning for dummies
    problem definitions

        training defintion:         
            supervised 
                expected output values are given during training
            unsupervised 
                expected output values are not given during training
            reinforcement learning
                the mouse in a maze problem, after a move some reward might or might not be given

        return value definitions:
            classification/categorization problem
